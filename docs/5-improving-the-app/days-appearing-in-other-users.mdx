# Days info apeears in other users

If we run the app, using a different simulator, as the app is running there for the first time, we expect it to be empty... but it's not! All days that we create in one Simulator appear in the other! But in the second one we don't have any habits!

What is happening here?

## Checking that we have two different users

We'll add a third tab to our tab view to show the current user id:

```swift title="MainView.swift"
    Text(realm.syncSession?.parentUser()?.id ?? "")
        .tabItem {
            Text("Debug")
        }
```

We'll see different users logged in here. As we're running the app in two different devices (simulators) and we're doing anonymous authentication, on each simulator we have a different anonymous user logged in, with a different `user.id`.

## If we add a new day, it also appears in other users' app!

Having two different simulators open, add a new day and you'll see it appearing almost instantly in the other simulator. This is not what we want: we want each user to access their own data. But it's also a cool demo of how fast Atlas Device Sync can sync data between devices. But yet it's a bug, I won't call it a "feature".

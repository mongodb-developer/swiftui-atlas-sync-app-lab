# Adding the Flexible Sync Configuration

Las thing we need to do is to pass this information to a new view, `OpenSyncedRealmView`, that will open the connection with our App and go through all the states needed while logging in our app.

```swift
// Remove this
//            Text("Logged in \(user)")

OpenSyncedRealmView(app: app)
                .environment(\.realmConfiguration, config)
```

## Final listing for SyncContentView

```swift title="SyncContentView.swift"
import SwiftUI
import RealmSwift

struct SyncContentView: View {
    // Observe the Realm app object in order to react to login state changes.
    @ObservedObject var app: RealmSwift.App

    var body: some View {
        if let user = app.currentUser {
            // If there is a user logged in

            // Create a `flexibleSyncConfiguration` with `initialSubscriptions`.
            // We'll inject this configuration as an environment value to use when opening the realm
            // in the next view, and the realm will open with these initial subscriptions.
            let config = user.flexibleSyncConfiguration(initialSubscriptions: { subs in
            // Check whether the subscription already exists. Adding it more
            // than once causes an error.
            if let foundSubscriptions = subs.first(named: "user_days") {
                    // Existing subscription found - do nothing
                    return
            } else {
                    // Add queries for any objects you want to use in the app
                    // Linked objects do not automatically get queried, so you
                    // must explicitly query for all linked objects you want to include
                    subs.append(QuerySubscription<Days>(name: "user_days", query: {
                    // Query for objects where the ownerId is equal to the app's current user's id
                    // This means the app's current user can read and write their own data
                    $0.ownerId == user.id
                    }))
                    subs.append(QuerySubscription<Day>())
                    subs.append(QuerySubscription<Habits>(name: "user_habits", query: {
                    // Query for objects where the ownerId is equal to the app's current user's id
                    // This means the app's current user can read and write their own data
                    $0.ownerId == user.id
                    }))
                    subs.append(QuerySubscription<Habit>())
            }
            })

            OpenSyncedRealmView(app: app)
                .environment(\.realmConfiguration, config)
        } else {
            // If there is no user logged in, show the login view.
            ProgressView()
                .task{
                    do {
                        let myUser = try await app.login(credentials: .anonymous)
                    } catch {
                        print("\(error)")
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}

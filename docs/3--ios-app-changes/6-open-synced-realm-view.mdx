# OpenSyncedRealmView

This wiew will check how our connection to MongoDB Atlas progress and will inform us if there's any error. Once is connected with a Synced Realm (in `case .open(let realm)`) it shows our old friend `MainView`. As we're adding to the `environment` this new, synced Realm our app will keep working as before, storing everything locally AND syncing to our MongoDB Database.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import RealmSwift

/// This view opens a synced realm.
struct OpenSyncedRealmView: View {
    @ObservedObject var app: RealmSwift.App

    // We've injected a `flexibleSyncConfiguration` as an environment value,
    // so `@AsyncOpen` here opens a realm using that configuration.
    @AsyncOpen(appId: nil, timeout: 4000) var asyncOpen
    
    var body: some View {
        // Because we are setting the `ownerId` to the `user.id`, we need
        // access to the app's current user in this view.
        let user = app.currentUser
        switch asyncOpen {
        // Starting the Realm.asyncOpen process.
        // Show a progress view.
        case .connecting:
            ProgressView()
        // Waiting for a user to be logged in before executing
        // Realm.asyncOpen.
        case .waitingForUser:
            ProgressView("Waiting for user to log in...")
        // The realm has been opened and is ready for use.
        // Show the content view.
        case .open(let realm):
            MainView()
            .environment(\.realm, realm)
        // The realm is currently being downloaded from the server.
        // Show a progress view.
        case .progress(let progress):
            ProgressView(progress)
        // Opening the Realm failed.
        // Show an error view.
        case .error(let error):
            Text(error.localizedDescription)
                .font(.callout)
                .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                .padding(.bottom, 40).padding()
        }
    }
}

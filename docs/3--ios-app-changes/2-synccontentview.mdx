# SyncContentView

## Create SyncContentView

This view observes the Realm app object. Either directs the user to login, or opens a realm with a logged-in user.

The 1st time we open the app there is no logged in user, so we'll check `app.currentUser` and show the `ProgressView`. This `ProgressView` will run an async task to `await` our app to login, using the Atlas App. Here we use `.anonymous` authentication, although we have several other ways to do authentication (configurable in Atlas).

Once the login succeeds, there will be a user in `app.currentUser`. As we're observing changes in `app`, we'll enter the `if` part and show a "Logged In!" `Text`

```swift title='SyncContentView.swift' 
import SwiftUI
import RealmSwift

struct SyncContentView: View {
    // Observe the Realm app object in order to react to login state changes.
    @ObservedObject var app: RealmSwift.App

    var body: some View {
        if let user = app.currentUser {
            // If there is a user logged in
            Text("Logged in \(user)")
        } else {
            // If there is no user logged in, show the login view.
            ProgressView()
                .task{
                    do {
                        let myUser = try await app.login(credentials: .anonymous)
                    } catch {
                        print("\(error)")
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}
```

## SyncContentView Preview

We need to inject an App, as SyncContentView observes the Realm app object, so we create a dummy `RealmSwift.App` with no App ID.

```swift title='SyncContentView.swift' 
struct SyncContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {

    static let app: RealmSwift.App? = RealmSwift.App(id: "none")

    static var previews: some View {
        SyncContentView(app: app!)
    }
}
```

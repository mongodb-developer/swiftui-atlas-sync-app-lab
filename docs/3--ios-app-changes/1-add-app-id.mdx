# Add an App id

## App id

In the App, we'll add a reference to the Atlas Services App we've created before. In App Services, [find and copy the App ID](/docs/app-services/create-a-new-app#app-id).

```swift title='GoodHabitsRealmApp.swift' 
    let app: RealmSwift.App? = RealmSwift.App(id: "My App Id")
```

## SyncContentView

To wait for the connection, do login, etc. we'll use a view that will take care of the different connection states our app will have. This View is called [`SyncContentView`](/docs/app-startup/synccontentview), son we'll show that on App Startup.

```swift title='GoodHabitsRealmApp.swift' 
import SwiftUI
import RealmSwift

@main
struct GoodHabitsRealmAppApp: SwiftUI.App {

    let app: RealmSwift.App? = RealmSwift.App(id: "My App Id")

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            SyncContentView(app: app!)
        }
    }
}
```

# Finishing Sync

We have a problem: while syncing habits we're using our user id, but not while syncing our days. From the sync config code, these are the subscriptions we're adding:

```swift title="SyncContentView.swift"
                    subs.append(QuerySubscription<Days>(name: "user_days", query: { 
                        $0.ownerId == user.id
                    }))
                    subs.append(QuerySubscription<Day>())

                    subs.append(QuerySubscription<Habits>(name: "user_habits", query: {
                        $0.ownerId == user.id
                    }))
                    subs.append(QuerySubscription<Habit>())
```

When we add a `Day` we never set the `ownerId` because our model class `Day` doesn't have it. So when we insert a new `Day` it will appear for all users, as we're getting `Day` from all users, because we're not restricting the sync here:


```swift title="SyncContentView.swift"
                    subs.append(QuerySubscription<Day>())
```

So we need to do two things:
- subscribe just to our Days
- add the `ownnerId` when we create a new `Day`

## Fixing the model: remove Days class

Let's get rid of Days, as we don't really use that class for anything.

## Add ownerId field to Day class

We;ll add the `ownerId` field to the Day class.

```swift title="Day.swift"
import Foundation
import RealmSwift

public class Day: Object, ObjectKeyIdentifiable {
    @Persisted(primaryKey: true) var _id: ObjectId

    @Persisted var date = Date()
    @Persisted var habits = RealmSwift.List<Habit>()

    @Persisted var ownerId = ""

    // ... same as before
```

## Remove sync on Days and add sync info to Day

We'll delete the sync subscription on `Days` (as we just deleted that class) and add the correct subscription for `Day`.

```swift title="SyncContentView.swift"
        if let foundSubscription = subs.first(named: "user_days") {
            return
        } else {
            subs.append(QuerySubscription<Day>(name: "user_days", query: {
                $0.ownerId == user.id
            }))

            subs.append(QuerySubscription<Habits>(name: "user_habits", query: {
                $0.ownerId == user.id
            }))
            subs.append(QuerySubscription<Habit>())
        }
```

## Set ownerId while creating a new Day

```swift title="DaysView.swift"
    let day = Day.createDayWithHabitsInRealm(realm: realm)

    day.ownerId = realm.syncSession?.parentUser()?.id ?? ""
    try? realm.write({
        $days.append(day)
    })
```

## Add ownerId when creating the initial set of Habits

```swift title="MainView.swift"
    ProgressView()
        .onAppear {
            let habits = Habits()
            habits.ownerId = realm.syncSession?.parentUser()?.id ?? ""
            $allHabitGroups.append(habits)
        }
```

## Testing it

Now if we run the app new days are not appearing in other users' apps.

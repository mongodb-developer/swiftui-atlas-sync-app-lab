# Get started with MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas is a data platform, designed for developers, which integrates a multi-cloud database with various data services. It simplifies the process of database deployment and management while facilitating the development of modern data-driven application.

The MongoDB Atlas registration is completely free and doesn't require a credit card. Follow the link below and create your account:

## Deploy a cloud database

Next, deploy your forever-free cloud database in MongoDB Atlas.

1. Click on the **Build a Database** button.

        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-1-mongodb-atlas/create-a-database.png')}
        width="500"
    />

1. Select **M0** â€” the free shared tier.

    />

1. Select a cloud provider and a region close to you. Rename your database to **AtlasSearchSoccer**.

        alt="Configuration settings for cloud provider, region and database name"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-1-mongodb-atlas/select-cloud-provider-region-name.png')}
    />

1. Click **Create** to deploy your database.

## Security quickstart

:::info
By default your Atlas deployment is completely locked down. To access it, you need to create access credentials and configure network access.

1. To create a database user, provide secure credentials and click **Create User**.

    <img
        alt="Security quickstart page showing the 'Create user' section"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-1-mongodb-atlas/create-user.png')}
    />

1. Next, configure the IP address list. Only connections coming from the allow-listed IPs will be accepted. You should see that your IP address was added by default.  Additionally, add the address `0.0.0.0/0` which allows access from anywhere and click **Add Entry**.

    <img
        alt="IP Access List configuration"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-1-mongodb-atlas/ip-access-list.png')}
    />

1. Finally, click **Finish and Close** and then, **Go to Databases**.

1. Creating the database may take a minute. Once the deployment is complete, you'll see your database in the list!

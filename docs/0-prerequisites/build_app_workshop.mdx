# Build an App using the Realm SDK to store data locally

This lab is based on the [SwiftUI Atlas Device SDK App Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/swiftui-atlas-device-sdk-app-lab/) where we build a simple habit-tracking app using SwiftUI and the Atlas Device SDK (formerly known as Realm SDK). This app stores data locally and our objective now is to add Atlas Device Sync to that app. 

You can either:
- follow the lab 
- grab the code cloning the [repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/swiftui-atlas-device-sdk-app-lab) and navigating to the [GoodHabitsRealmApp](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/swiftui-atlas-device-sdk-app-lab/tree/main/GoodHabitsRealmApp) folder.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/swiftui-atlas-device-sdk-app-lab
cd GoodHabitsRealmApp
open GoodHabitsRealmApp.xccodeproj
```

And then compiling the App in Xcode.

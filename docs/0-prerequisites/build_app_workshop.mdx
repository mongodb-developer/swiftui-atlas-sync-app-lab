# Build an App using the Realm SDK to store data locally

This lab is based on the [SwiftUI Realm App Workshop](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/swiftui-realm-app-workshop/) where we build a simple habit-tracking app using SwiftUI and the Realm SDK. This app stores data locally and our objective now is to add Atlas Device Sync to that app. 

You can either:
- follow the lab 
- grab the code cloning the [repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/swiftui-realm-app-workshop) and navigating to the [GoodHabitsRealmApp](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/swiftui-realm-app-workshop/tree/main/GoodHabitsRealmApp) folder.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/swiftui-realm-app-workshop
cd GoodHabitsRealmApp
open GoodHabitsRealmApp.xccodeproj
```

And then compiling the App in Xcode.

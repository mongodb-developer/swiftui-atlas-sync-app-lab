# Xcode 14

We need to install Xcode from:
- the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- downloading it [from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/)

Once installed, open it. The first time it will ask to install additional components, but the ones already selected (iOS and macOS) are enough for this workshop.
